### Kia ora! üëã

My name is No√©mie and I'm a software developer based in Wellington New Zealand. I've always been attracted to coding and finally took the plunge in 2019 when I joined Enspiral Dev Academy Bootcamp. I am now grateful to have reached a space where I can simultaneously solve problems, satisfy my learning appetites, collaborate with others, be creative, binge on logical thinking, and be part of something bigger. I'm on a journey to learn how to create meaningful solutions that empower people, one step at a time.
